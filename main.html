<title>Engineering Ethics Tool</title>

<body>


<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>A lot of us go into engineering because we’re motivated by altruism and genuinely want to make the world a better place. It can, however, be difficult to live your values when you’re searching for a job. This tool will help you consider the ethical implications of various career paths in engineering. These ethical challenges span six areas: Equity, Labor, Corporate Citizenship, Privacy, Environment, and Safety.</p>

<h1>Get Started</h1>

<p>What do you think are some ethical issues in your chosen industry?</p>

<h1>About the Tool</h1>
<p>I became an engineer because I was good at math and science in high school, and I was told that engineering would allow me to use my technical aptitude for social good. Starting engineering school, I found that many students, particularly women and other underrepresented groups, shared my aspirations of social good. However, most graduates were entering the conventional engineering job market, and their jobs were oriented towards profit rather than social impact.</p>
<p>It is time for an ethical reckoning in engineering education. As someone who cares deeply about stopping climate change, I am disappointed in the ways our profession has enabled carbon-intensive industries, and we must transform it. Obviously, we need systemic change – but your individual choice of career will nonetheless make a difference. With this tool, my goal is to create a dialogue about ethical careers for engineering students.</p>
<p>Everyone’s circumstances are different, and there may be factors that complicate your ethical decisions, like if you have student loans or need to live near family. Besides, no company is perfect, and every one is going to have some level of ethical challenge.</p>
<p>This tool does not prescribe a certain path – it doesn’t make sense for us all to work on the same societal problem – but <b>I hope you will use it to reflect on your ethical limits, what types of work you feel are acceptable, and how you will use your power as an engineer to work towards a more just and equitable society.</b></p>
<p>The tool is United States-centric, due to the fact that I live in the United States and I imagine that most people who use it will also live in developed countries. That said, I believe that the lessons and issues discussed here are relevant to every engineer worldwide.</p>

<h2>Explanation of Ethical Areas</h2>
<p>Although there are undoubtedly unlimited areas of ethical exposure, some of which we don’t even know of yet, I’ve identified six main areas to explore in this tool:</p>
<ul><b>Equity</b>: How does this industry’s work contribute to or detract from racial equity, gender parity, LGBTQ+ and disability rights, economic inequality, etc?</ul>
<ul><b>Labor</b>: What are this industry’s practices like with regards to wages and benefits, unionization, workplace safety, and how do those practices affect labor rights and employee quality of life writ large?</ul>
<ul><b>Corporate Citizenship</b>: How does this industry affect communities? Do companies pay taxes? What do they lobby for? To what extent does this company prioritize profit over and above social good when making decisions?</ul>
<ul><b>Privacy</b>: How does this industry’s business model affect consumer and worker privacy?</ul>
<ul><b>Environment</b>: How does this industry propagate climate change and other types of ecological devastation?</ul>
<ul><b>Safety</b>: How does this industry affect the safety of the general public?</ul>

<p>Many ethical issues span these categories – for example, the use of pesticides in agriculture is an environmental concern because these can pollute watersheds, but it also a safety concern for those who eat food. Also, not every industry will have a clear-cut ethical issue for every category, and the list of issues is not exhaustive. These categories and the discussion are presented as a starting point.</p>
